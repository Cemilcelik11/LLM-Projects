# TEAM OF AGENTS PROJECT

## Credits
This project is prepared by coding along the video of the YouTube channel **Codebasics**.

## Details
  - This code sets up a team of AI agents using the **Phi framework**, which leverages the **Groq model** and tools for retrieving data from the web and financial markets.
  - Phi is the main python-based framework designed for managing agents and LLMs. It provides tools to integrate models, APIs, and other utilities.
  - Dotenv is a library that loads environment variables from a .env file to securely manage API keys.
  - In our web agent, we use DuckDuckGo tool for performing web searches.
  - As Groq LLM we used llama-3.3 since it is moderately good and free.
  - For the finance agent we used YFinanceTools library to fetch the stock prices, analyst recommendations and company information.
  - The purpose of agent team is to combine the web and finance agents. The team delegates tasks to individual agents tailored to their capabilities.
